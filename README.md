# Python Task Optimisation and Interoperability - Subprocess Module

This jupyter notebook was presented on the [Research Bazar Conference 2019](https://research.unimelb.edu.au/infrastructure/research-platform-services/training/research-bazaar/melbourne-resbaz-2019).

The goal was to provide a simple recipe of a Python package/function that could be used by scientists and anyone else attending the meeting.

I believe subprocess is a great example on how you can integrate other programs and command line outputs, which can be very usefull when doing research and having to handle data from different sources and different formats.

## Installation

The best way to run this code is to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or [Miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

After installing Anaconda, run the following steps on a terminal of your choice.

+ Step 1 - Create the environment from the __requirements.yml__ file:
```
conda env create -f requirements.yml
```

+ Step 2 - Run jupyter:
```
jupyter notebook
```
